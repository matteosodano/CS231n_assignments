# CS231n Homework Assignments

This is just a copy-pasted and sanitized version of the code assignments
found in the [original page](https://cs231n.github.io/). We have copied the
local development files(Option B for all homeworks). If you plane to use
Google collab, then, this is not for you.

## How-to start

Just fork this repository and start working on your local machine. You should only have `python3` installed and `jupyter-notebooks` or `jupyter-lab`. The rest of the dependencies can be installed by just running:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
